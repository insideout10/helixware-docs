Uploading Videos
================

.. note::

    HelixWare is integrated in WordPress, the upload of videos is performed using the well-known `Add New Media` page of
    WordPress.


Log into the WordPress admin screen, and click on `Media \ Add New` from the left side menu:

.. note::

    The WordPress standard upload limit does not apply to HelixWare uploads. The HelixWare upload limit is specified
    right after WordPress limit and is usually more than one GB.

The upload will start, a bar will show its progress:

When the upload is complete, you can create a new `post` by selecting its type, title and tags. Then click on `Save`:

.. note::

    HelixWare plugin will create a post with the video player shortcode embedded in its content. HelixWare plugin will
    also create a video thumbnail (by default using the frame at 15") that will be set as *featured image*.

When the post is saved, an *edit* link appears. You can click this link to open the *edit post* screen.

.. warning::

    If you click on the *edit* link while other uploads are still in progress, you might interrupt them. It is strongly
    recommended for all the uploads to finish before clicking on the *edit* link. You can always edit the posts by going
    to the posts list at a later stage.
